# Who Are You

For this project, I updated the Recurrent Neural Network to use the GRU cell rather than the LSTM cell in order to optimize the algorithm for the fisher corpus dataset.  The optimized code is found in the BiRNN.py file called BiRNN3.  While this is meant to predict gender, our goal is to make other predictions such as region and age to better speech recognition software for people.
